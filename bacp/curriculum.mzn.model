% The balanced academic curriculum problem: see
% http://www.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~ianm/CSPLib/prob/prob030/spec.html
%
% A curriculum is a set of courses with prerequisites.
%
% Each course must be assigned within a set number of periods.
%
% A course cannot be scheduled before its prerequisites.
%
% Each course confers a number of academic credits (it's "load").
%
% Students have lower and upper bounds on the number of credits
% they can study for in a given period.
%
% Students have lower and upper bounds on the number of courses
% they can study for in a given period.
%
% The goal is to assign a period to every course satisfying these
% criteria, minimising the load for all periods.
