Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem
===================================

cvrp_mip.mzn      MIP formulation

cvrp_cp.mzn       CP formulation (using the formulation from the CP
                  handbook with the giant tour representation and
                  the circuit constraint). No sym breaking constraints.

simple*.dzn       simple instances made by hand (only for testing)

A-n*.dzn          A-set benchmarks (random customer locations and demand)
B-n*.dzn          B-set benchmarks (clustered locations)
P-n*.dzn          P-set benchmarks (modified instances from literature)

                  The A,B,P benchmarks come from Augerat et al [1] where
                  n is the number of customers. They are also available
                  in text format at [2].

The best known solutions for all the instances of the A, B and P sets are
available from the website at [3].
