% Nurse scheduling problem

%
% The nurse scheduling problem consists of assigning nurses to shifts to
% satisfy  nurses demand for each day.
% The model includes the following constraints:
% - each shift has a minimum required number of nurses
% - various regulation rules on each nurse schedule
% To run the model you need a data file from ./period_14 or ./period_28 to
% specify the minimum number of nurses required on each day[*]
%
%[*]Original benchmarks come from  http://www.projectmanagment.ugent.be/nsp.php
% They specify minimal required staff allocation for each shift and individual
% preferences for each nurse.  We ignore these preference and replace them with
% a set of constraints that model common workload restrictions for all nurses.
% The number of nurses in each instance is set to the maximal number of nurses
% required for any day over the period multiplied by 1.5.

% To test the model:

% nsp_1.mzn --data test.dzn
